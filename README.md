# svelte hitch tracker app

This is a frontend that may or may not eventually turn into a full application for tracking charity hitchhikes.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start the [Rollup dev server](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Deployment :rocket:
(we'll get there eventually)
